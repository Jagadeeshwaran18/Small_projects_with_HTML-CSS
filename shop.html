                <h2>Wedding Decoration</h2>
                <p>Simple wedding reception table decoration ideas don't need to be limited to the table itself. Feel
                    free to get creative
                    and look upward with your decor. By hanging some decor you'll minimize the number of items on
                    the table itself so everything stays pared down and clean.Sticking to a neutral palette is a great
                    option if you're dreaming of simple wedding reception decor ideas.
                    This couple leaned into beige decor, but added a pop of shimmer with some disco balls.Opting for
                    just a few long tables, instead of lots of smaller round tables, is a
                    great way to simplify your wedding reception floor plan. This couple seated all their guests at
                    three parallel tables with green linens and the result was beautiful.</p>

                <h2>Wedding Garland</h2>
                <p>In Indian weddings, garlands, known as Jaimala or Varamala, are exchanged by the bride and groom as a
                    symbol of mutual respect, love, and commitment.
                    This tradition signifies the couple's acceptance of each other and the beginning of their marital
                    journey. The garlands, often made of flowers, are
                    not just decorative but also carry cultural and spiritual significance, representing prosperity,
                    auspiciousness, and the enduring nature of the union.
                    Every culture lends its unique customs to the wedding ceremony, and Indian weddings are renowned for
                    their exuberant celebrations and elaborate rituals surrounding
                    the union of the bride and groom. Here is what you could see floral-wise if you attend an Indian
                    wedding, since flowers play a significant role in the decorating and ceremony involved.
                    The bride and groom exchange flower garlands as part of the Hindu wedding rite (a ritual called
                    jaimala or varmala). They are delicately weaved from blooming flowers,
                    typically marigolds, jasmine, and roses, though the exact flowers used might change depending on the
                    season. Similar to how rings are exchanged at a western wedding
                    ceremony, this exchange has equivalent importance.Flowers are sunlight, nourishment, and medicine
                    for the spirit; they make people better, happier, and more helpful.
                    So, it comes as no surprise that flowers are an essential component of every Hindu ritual while
                    bearing in mind these eternal words. These lovely blossoms are a
                    beloved component of the ceremonies and the décor during weddings and funerals. Flowers are
                    frequently used at Indian weddings.</p>

                <h2>Gods Decoration</h2>
                <p>Gods and goddesses are often depicted and celebrated through various forms of decoration,
                    particularly in religious and cultural contexts.
                    These decorations can include statues, paintings, floral arrangements, and symbolic items like lamps
                    and incense. In religious settings,
                    elaborate decorations often adorn temples, shrines, and homes during festivals and special
                    occasions.God's decorations, especially in the
                    context of religious or spiritual practices, refer to the adornments and enhancements applied to
                    idols, temples, or sacred spaces associated
                    with deities. These decorations are often deeply intertwined with cultural and religious beliefs,
                    holding significant symbolism and meaning beyond their aesthetic appeal. </p>

                <h2>Gods Garland</h2>
                <p>In Hindu tradition, garlands, or "malas," are floral or leaf-based decorations used to honor deities,
                    guests, and at various ceremonies.
                    They symbolize respect, blessings, and adornment, with specific flowers often associated with
                    particular deities. Garlands play a significant
                    role in religious rituals, particularly during worship (puja), where they are offered to idols and
                    images.Garlands serve as offerings to the gods
                    in magnificent temples, in domestic rituals, and in public ceremonies of devotion. The name of the
                    Hindu worship ritual 'puja' that translates to
                    the “flower act” emphasises the significance of flowers in the religious context.Garlands of various
                    flowers and leaves are offered to deities and
                    adorn their statues or images. In other religious, cultural and secular functions, flower garlands
                    are used for decorative purposes and also presented
                    to people as a sign of blessing and honour. Garlands play a significant
